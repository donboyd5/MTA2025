# Introduction

Under legislation enacted with the 2019-20 New York State budget, the state and NYC were required to direct a portion of their sales taxes to the MTA to reflect sales tax gains estimated to be related to the Internet Marketplace Act. (See the Background section at the end for details.)

These diversions were set at \$320 million in the first full state fiscal year (\$170 million NYC, \$150 million state) and were required to grow 1% annually. The table below shows recent and projected amounts on an MTA fiscal year basis.

The question at hand is whether the state and city gained more from the Internet Marketplace Act than shown above. If so, an argument might be made to increase the funds diverted to the MTA from state and city sales taxes.
