# PMT tax base and rate rules

Tax & Finance - [employers](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/mctmt/emp.htm),

## Tax base and taxpayers

Taxpayers (7/1/2023+) do NOT include:

-   an agency or instrumentality of the United States;\
    **Note:** For an employer to be an agency or instrumentality of the United States, there must be (1) a federal law specifically stating the employer is an agency or instrumentality of the United States, or (2) a decision in a federal court case which specifically states that the employer is an agency or instrumentality of the United States. 

-   the United Nations;

-   an interstate agency or public corporation created pursuant to an agreement or compact with another state or Canada;

-   a federally chartered credit union;

-   a household employer on wages paid to household employees; or

-   any eligible educational institution including:

    -   a public school district,

    -   Board of Cooperative Educations Services (BOCES),

    -   a public elementary or secondary school,

    -   a school that serves students with disabilities of school age as defined in Article 85 or 89 of the Education Law,

    -   a nonpublic elementary or secondary school that provides instruction in grade one or above, or

    -   all public library systems \[as defined by section 272(1) of the Education Law\] and all public and free association libraries \[as defined by section 253(2) of the Education Law\] beginning with the first quarter of 2016.

## Tax rates

## Tax calculation

For purposes of calculating the MCTMT, the MCTD is divided into two zones:

-   **Zone 1 (NYC)** includes the counties of New York (Manhattan), Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, and Richmond (Staten Island).

-   **Zone 2 (suburban counties)** includes the counties of Rockland, Nassau, Suffolk, Orange, Putnam, Dutchess, and Westchester.

Your MCTMT due for a calendar quarter is the sum of:

1.  your [payroll expense](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/mctmt/def_ps.htm#pe) in the calendar quarter for all [covered employees](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/mctmt/def_ce.htm) in Zone 1 multiplied by the applicable MCTMT rate from Table 1 below, **and**

2.  your payroll expense in the calendar quarter for all covered employees in Zone 2 multiplied by the applicable MCTMT rate from Table 2 below.

**Note:** In order to be subject to the MCTMT for the quarter, the employer must have payroll expense in the entire MCTD (both Zone 1 and Zone 2) greater than \$312,500.

**Example:** *An employer has payroll expense within the MCTD of \$650,000. \$450,000 of that payroll expense is attributable to Zone 1 and \$200,000 of that payroll expense is attributable to Zone 2. The employer’s MCTMT liability is \$2,920 (\[\$450,000 x 0.60%\] + \[\$200,000 x 0.11%\]).*

## Initial enactment (from my [Fall 2023 forecast](https://boyd-mta-forecast-fall2023.netlify.app/timing_lawchanges.html))

Part C of Chapter 25 of the Laws of 2009 added Article 23 to the Tax Law which establishes the metropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax (MCTMT).

It was signed on May 7, 2009. The wage tax was generally effective March 1, 2009 (September 1, 2009 for public school districts) and the self-employment tax was effective for tax years beginning in 2009. (Part C section 23 of the chapter for effective dates.)

## **The 2011 payroll mobility tax reductions**

### **The change and its effective date**

Part B of Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2011, obtainable [here](http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/navigate.cgi?NVDTO:) reduced revenue from the payroll tax. Among other things it:

-   raised the quarterly payroll threshold for taxation from \$2,500 to \$312,500

-   added lower rates for taxable employers with quarterly payroll below \$437,500 and

-   exempted public school districts and certain other educational institutions

The changes took effect for the quarter beginning April 2012. The bill was signed on December 11, 2012, meaning the Tax Department, employers, and tax advisors had approximately 3 months to prepare for implementation and response. As a tax reduction, employers had greater incentive to comply quickly with the changes than they do for the 2023 increase.

## The 2023 increase

NYS increased the PMT as follows (see [transportation bill](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2023/S4008C))

-   Payroll tax rate on NYC employers with quarterly payroll greater than \$437,500 (annual rate of \$1.75 million)

    -   increased from 0.34% to 0.60% (+76.47%).

    -   payroll tax provisions take effect immediately and “shall apply to tax quarters beginning on or after July 1, 2023”

-   Self-employment net earnings tax rate on NYC net earnings was increased:

    -   from 0.34% to 0.47% (+38.24%) for TY beginning in 2023 (because most taxpayers are calendar-year taxpayers, this mostly will apply to net self-employment earnings earned in calendar year 2023)

    -   from 0.34% to 0.60% (+76.47%) for TY beginning in 2024+.

The \$50,000 threshold for taxability was not changed

## **Fiscal impact estimates for the 2023 increase**

During budget process:

-   Full-year \~\$1.1 billion

-   First year: DOB estimate was \~\$460m, KW believes

Boyd estimates in June 2023

-   2023 (conservative to optimistic) \$407-419m – (\$381-393 wages, \~\$26 self-employment)

-   2024 (conservative to optimistic) \$1,038-1089m - (\$979-1,024 wages, \~\$59-66 self-employment)

MTA July Financial Plan (July 2023 estimates, prepared a bit earlier)

-   2023: \$419m

-   2024: \$1,112m (+ \~4% annually in later years)

## Professional employer organizations (PEOs)

The guidance on this page applies to tax quarters beginning on or after 7/1/23. 

For guidance on the return due 7/31/23, for the quarter ending 6/30/23, see [Publication 420](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/publications/mctmt/pub420.pdf), *Guide to the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax*. 

If you are a PEO (as defined in section 916 of the Labor Law; see [TSB-M-12(2)MCTMT](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/memos/mta_mobility/m12_2mctmt.pdf), *Computation of the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax for Professional Employer Organizations)* you must calculate your MCTMT due based separately on:

-   the payroll expense of your own organization; **and**

-   the payroll expense of each client with whom you have entered into a professional employer agreement.
