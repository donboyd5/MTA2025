# PMT database development steps

Goals:

-   Database suitable for estimating PMT with different rates for NYC and rest of MTA and different rates by size of firm
-   With wages, \# of firms or establishments, \# of employees
-   By industry, year, size of firm, county
-   Calibrated to QCEW wages and to tax revenue
-   [Old notes: Data on employer size -- see discussion](https://mta-baseline.netlify.app/pmtbase/pmt_stopgap)

Current approach steps:

-   Get County Business Patterns 2022 (latest) for NY counties, with employment and wages by industry and establishment size
    -   Estimate number of establishments and average employment by county-naics-size group
    -   Estimate average employment by establishment size-group
