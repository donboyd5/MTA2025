# State personal income tax credit for SALT impact

## Basic idea

-   Eligibility:
    -   NYS resident
    -   NYS AGI \<= \$300k
    -   Federal itemizer
    -   Federal allowable itemized deductions exceed federal standard deduction
    -   Potential SALT deductions greater than \$10,000
-   Calculation:
    -   Credit base = lesser of excess SALT deductions and excess itemized deductions
        -   Excess SALT deductions = state and local taxes paid minus \$10,000 cap
        -   Excess itemized deductions = itemized deductions minus standard (not less than zero)
    -   Credit before cap = credit base x 30%
    -   Credit = lesser of uncapped credit and \$1,500
